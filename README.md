# Computer Vision Practise:

The purpose of this repository is to not fall half asleep while learning fundamental concepts in Computer Vision.

It's active learning!
 
- Let R denote the set of Reals, and U denote the set Union operation.

- Let R^{n} denote an N dimensional Euclidean Space (A Vector Space w/ the dot product operation).

- Note: A Vector Space E over Field R is the set of all Vectors with Production Rules: 
	- v+u in E | v, u in E // Vector-Vector Addition
	- vxr in E | v in E, r in R //'x' denotes Vector-Scalar Multiplication

Defn 1 - An Image can be defined as:

f in U R^{ixNxM} | N in Z+, M in Z+, i in [1, 3]


What is an edge-detector?

What is an edge in an Image?

An edge is a high intensity pixel? Nope, too naive.

An edge is an ordered-set of pixels with high-entropy compared to neighbouring pixels.

An edge is the chain (ordered-set) of with intra-similarity and inter-dissimilarity.

Don't why anyone would wanna clone this...It's literally notes.
